# WEEK CHALLENGES (WEDNESDAY)
## A. PIZZA 🍕
### 1. Know what flavor of pizza we are going to cook
### 2. Verify which ingredients are available and which ones are not
### 3. Buy the ingredients that are missing
### 4. Prepare the ingredients so they are ready from the beginning
### 5. Prepare and shape the dough
### 6. Add the sauce and ingredients to the dough
### 7. Prepare the oven to the correct temperature
### 8. Put the pizza in the oven and wait for 15 minutes
### 9. Take out the pizza and enjoy it.

## B. Hot N Cold 🥶
### 1. Know whether we want to convert from C to F or from F to C.
### 2. Obtain the value to be converted -> N
### 3. Convert from C to F
#### 3.1 Use the formula -> R = (N * 1.8) + 32
#### 3.2 Return the result in degrees Fahrenheit -> R°F
### 4. Convert from F to C
#### 4.1 Use the formula -> R = (N – 32) * .5556
#### 4.2 Return the result in degrees Celsius -> R°C
### 5. End the algorithm.

## C. Geometry 📐
### 1. Know which geometric figure we want to know its volume.
### 2. If the figure to find the volume is a pyramid:
#### 2.1 Ask for the values of its base and height, and store them in variables as bl = base lenght, bw = base width and h = height.
#### 2.2 Use the formula with the values of the base and the height -> R=(1/3)(bl * bh * h)
#### 2.3 Return the result of the volume of the pyramid with its respective unit.
### 3. If the figure to find the volume is a cube:
#### 3.1 Ask for the value of its area and store it in a variable as a = area.
#### 3.2 Use the formula for the volume -> R=a^3
#### 3.3 Return the result of the volume of the cube with its respective unit.
### 4. If the figure to find the volume is a sphere:
#### 4.1 Ask for the value of its radius and store it in a variable as r = radius.
#### 4.2 Use the formula for the volume -> R= ((4/3)(πr))^3
#### 4.3 Return the result of the volume of the sphere with its respective unit.
### 5. End the algorithm.
